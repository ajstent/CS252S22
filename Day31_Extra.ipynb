Lee\\tBusiness & Finance\\t2014-03-31 14:01:30\\t2014-12-16 16:37:36\\thttp://www.vox.com/2014/3/31/5557170/bitcoin-bad-currency-good-network\\t\"Bitcoins have lost more than 60 percent of their value this year. But their long-term outlook is still bright.\"\\t<p>The markets haven\\'t been kind to<span> </span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/bitcoin/\" style=\"font-size: 17px; line-height: 28.4624996185303px;\">Bitcoin</a> in 2014. The currency reached a high of nearly $1,000 in January before falling to around $350 this month, a plunge of more than 60 percent. It would be easy to write Bitcoin off as a fad whose novelty has worn off.</p> \\\\n<p>After all, dollars seem superior in almost every respect. T<span>hey\\'re accepted everywhere, they\\'re convenient to use, and they have a stable value. Bitcoin is an inferior currency on all three counts.</span></p> \\\\n<p><q class=\"right\"><span>Bitcoin\\'s detractors are making the same mistake as many Bitcoin fans</span> </q></p> \\\\n<p><span>Yet it would be foolish to write Bitcoin off. The currency has had months-long slumps in the past, only to bounce back. </span>More importantly, it\\'s a mistake to think about Bitcoin as a new kind of currency. W<span>hat makes Bitcoin potentially revolutionary is that it\\'s the world\\'s first completely open financial network.</span></p> \\\\n<p><span>History suggests that open platforms like Bitcoin often become fertile soil for innovation. Think about the internet. It didn\\'t seem like a very practical technology in the 1980s. But it was an open platform that anyone could build on, and in the long run it proved to be really useful.</span></p> \\\\n<p>The internet succeeded because Silicon Valley have created applications that harness the internet\\'s power while shielding users from its complexity.\\xc2\\xa0<span>You don\\'t have to be an expert on the internet\\'s TCP/IP protocols to check Facebook on your iPhone.</span></p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin applications can work the same way. There are already some Bitcoin applications that allow customers to make transactions over the Bitcoin network without being exposed to fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin\\'s currency. That basic model should work for a wide variety of Bitcoin-based services, allowing the Bitcoin payment network to reach a mainstream audience.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215235/imp.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Imp\"></p> \\\\n<p><span><span></span></span></p> \\\\n<p class=\"caption\">This is the very first node on the ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet that launched in 1969. (Flickr/<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastlizard4/6294438012/\">FastLizard4</a>)</p> \\\\n<p><span></span></p> \\\\n<h3><span>The first open financial network</span></h3> \\\\n<p>The Bitcoin network serves the same purpose as mainstream payment networks such as Visa or Western Union. But there\\'s an important difference. The Visa and Western Union networks are owned and operated by for-profit companies. If you want to build a business based on one of those networks, you have to get permission from the owner.</p> \\\\n<p>And that\\'s not always easy. To use the Visa network, for example, you have to comply with\\xc2\\xa0<a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/visa-international-operating-regulations-main.pdf\">hundreds of pages</a> of regulations. The Visa network also has high fees, and there are some things Visa won\\'t let you do on its network at all.</p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin is different. Because no one owns or controls the network, there are no limits on how people can use it. Some people have used that freedom to do illegal things like buying drugs or gambling online. But it also means there\\'s a low barrier to entry for building new Bitcoin-based financial services.</p> \\\\n<p>There\\'s an obvious parallel to the internet. Before the internet became mainstream, the leading online services were commercial networks like Compuserve and Prodigy. The companies that ran the network decided what services would be available on them.</p> \\\\n<p><span>In contrast, the internet was designed for anyone to create new services. Tim Berners-Lee didn\\'t need to ask anyone\\'s permission to create the world wide web. He simply wrote the first web browser and web server and posted them online for others to download. Soon thousands of people were using the software and the web was born.</span></p> \\\\n<h3>Finding Bitcoin\\'s killer app</h3> \\\\n<p>So what will people do with Bitcoin? It\\'s hard to predict tomorrow\\'s innovations, but we can get some idea of Bitcoin\\'s potential by thinking about weaknesses of the conventional financial system.</p> \\\\n<p><q class=\"left\"><span>Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards</span></q></p> \\\\n<p>One obvious application is international money transfers. Companies like Western Union and Moneygram can charge as much as 8 percent to transfer cash from one country to another, and transfers can take as long as 3 days to complete. In contrast, Bitcoin transactions only take about 30 minutes to clear, and Bitcoin transaction fees could be a lot less than 8 percent.</p> \\\\n<p>People have been\\xc2\\xa0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/1/7139785/there-are-now-285-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world\">building Bitcoin ATMs</a> to let people convert between bitcoins and their local currency. The first Bitcoin ATM was launched a little over a year ago. Today, there are\\xc2\\xa0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://coinatmradar.com/\">329 of them</a>.</p> \\\\n<p><span>If these devices continue to proliferate, they could become a useful alternative to conventional money-transfer services. Currently, each machine charges a transaction fee of around 3 percent, so the total cost of transferring money from one Bitcoin ATM to another is around 6 percent. That\\'s comparable to the fees charged by incumbent money transfer services, and competition is likely to push down Bitcoin ATM fees over time.</span></p> \\\\n<p>A more ambitious application for Bitcoin would be as an alternative to credit cards for daily purchases. Startups such Bitpay have already figured out how to make Bitcoin attractive to merchants as a way of accepting payments. Credit card networks charge merchants around 3 percent to process transactions. Bitpay charges 1 percent or less to accept Bitcoin payments on behalf of merchants. Bitpay merchants don\\'t have to worry about the headache of disputed payments known as \"chargebacks.\"</p> \\\\n<p><span>Of course, for Bitcoin to take off as an alternative to credit cards, consumers will have to start using them regularly. And that\\'s going to be a hard sell, especially if consumers are exposed to the risk of Bitcoin\\'s volatility.</span></p> \\\\n<p>But a Bitcoin-based payment app could also have some advantages. One is security. The current credit card network essentially works on the honor system, allowing any merchant to charge a credit card and relying on after-the-fact adjudication to police fraud. Bitcoin could allow companies to experiment with alternative approaches that build in security at the front end, for example by asking users to confirm a transaction on their smartphones before it\\'s approved. That could cut fraud, reducing the hassle of disputing fraudulent payments and allowing lower fees.</p> \\\\n<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is such a good deal for merchants that they may find it worthwhile to offer their customers discounts for paying with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit cards. That might entice bargain-hunting consumers who aren\\'t otherwise interested in trying a new payment technology.</p> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4215267/6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"6355318323_4c41d3ef76_b\"></p> \\\\n<p class=\"caption\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6355318323/sizes/l\" style=\"font-size: 12px; font-style: italic; line-height: 15px;\">401(K) 2013</a></p> \\\\n<h3><span>Using Bitcoin-the-network without Bitcoin-the-currency</span></h3> \\\\n<p>The biggest stumbling block for many Bitcoin services is Bitcoin\\'s volatility. The current generation of Bitcoin \"wallet\" apps, which store bitcoins on behalf of users, expose consumers to fluctuations in Bitcoin\\'s value. Ordinary consumers are unlikely to ever be comfortable with a payment system where their wealth can shrink by 10 percent or more in a single day.</p> \\\\n<p>Fortunately, it\\'s possible to design Bitcoin-based financial services that don\\'t expose users to fluctuations in Bitcoin\\'s value. Bitpay is a good example. Bitpay merchants set prices in conventional currencies such as the dollar, converting to the equivalent number of Bitcoins at the time of sale. Once the sale is made, Bitpay immediately converts it to an equivalent number of dollars and deposits the cash in the merchant\\'s conventional bank account. This means that from the merchant\\'s perspective, Bitpay is just another way of accepting dollars. A Bitpay merchant isn\\'t affected at all by fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>The same principle could apply to any other Bitcoin-based service. A consumer-friendly payments app could store a user\\'s cash in dollars, converting them to bitcoins at the time of payment. Under the hood the app could use the full power of the Bitcoin platform, but from the user\\'s perspective it would just seem like another way of paying for things with dollars.</p> \\\\n<p>You\\'re probably wondering: if Bitcoin\\'s value is as a payment network, why not just build an open payment network based on a conventional currency like the dollar? An open, dollar-based payment network would be a great idea. The problem is that no one has figured out how to build one.</p> \\\\n<p>Dollars in the Paypal network are worth a dollar because the Paypal company has promised to honor withdrawal requests. But there\\'s no organization to perform this role on a peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>Suppose there were a network called Dollarcoin that worked exactly like Bitcoin except a company called Dollarcoin Inc. promised to convert dollarcoins into dollars. Then the value of one dollarcoin would always equal one dollar. But as the manager of the Dollarcoin network, the Dollarcoin company would face pressure to comply with a variety of laws regarding fraud, money laundering, and so forth. To keep the costs of complying with those requirements under control, it would be forced to regulate who could use the network and how. (Indeed, that\\'s exactly what\\xc2\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-PayPal-Wars-Battles-Planet/dp/1936488590\">happened to Paypal</a> 15 years ago.) Over time, the Dollarcoin network could become as restrictive as conventional financial networks.</p> \\\\n<p>Bitcoin\\'s openness depends on the fact that no one owns the network. And with no owner, there\\'s no one to guarantee that bitcoins have a predictable value.</p> \\\\n<p>Many of Bitcoin\\'s early adopters were acolytes of Ron Paul\\'s brand of hard-money libertarianism. They were attracted to the promise of a currency whose supply was outside of state control, and as a consequence, Bitcoin has gained a reputation as the second coming of the gold standard. That, in turn, has made mainstream economists who are hostile to Ron Paul and the gold standard hostile to Bitcoin.</p> \\\\n<p>But in reality, the case for Bitcoin simply doesn\\'t have much to do with its unorthodox monetary policy. Bitcoin is a payment network that happens to have its own currency, not the other way around. It\\'s worth taking seriously whether or not you agree with Ron Paul\\'s views on the Federal Reserve.</p>\\n', b'6 health problems marijuana could treat better than traditional medicine\\tGerman Lopez\\tWar on Drugs\\t2014-03-31 15:44:21\\t2014-11-17 00:20:33\\thttp://www.vox.com/2014/3/31/5557700/six-problems-medical-marijuana-might-treat-better-than-traditional\\t\"Medical marijuana could fill gaps that currently exist in traditional medicine.\"\\t<p>Twenty states have so far legalized the medical use of marijuana, and researchers are starting to look at how, exactly, patients can put those laws to the best use.</p> \\\\n<p>There\\'s a burgeoning field of research exploring what medical conditions marijuana is best suited to treat \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and how, in certain cases, it might actually outperform traditional medicine.

But the argument <span class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\">is built</span> upon the most impressive set of data ever assembled about the history of wealth around the world, and that data <span class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\">tells</span> many stories beyond the main narrative argument of the book. Here we present nine charts drawn from the book that illustrate the history of the global economy.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>1) The fall and rise of Asia</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204525/World_Output.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"World_output\">300 years ago, a majority of the world\\'s economic output was located on the Asian continent. But with the coming of the Industrial Revolution, Europe\\'s share of the global economy increased substantially. As European settled the Western Hemisphere and brought industrial economics with them, the Americas rose as well. Asia\\'s share of world output shrunk massively, despite the continent\\'s enormous population. But over the past 20-30 years, Asia\\'s staged a massive comeback. Its share of world output isn\\'t yet back to where it was in 1714 but it\\'s getting close.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>2) The return of inequality in Britain</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204533/capital_in_britain.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Capital_in_britain\">This chart shows the extent and nature of British wealth as compared to British income. In the 18th and 19th centuries, <span class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\">wealth</span> was massive relative to income and much of it took the form of agricultural land. Over the course of the 19th century, the relative value of agricultural land shrunk and was largely replaced by \"net foreign capital,\" i.e. British ownership of foreign assets during the heyday of the British Empire. Then came the world wars. The foreign capital was liquidated to pay for the wars, and domestic capital shrunk. Circa 1950 the power of accumulated wealth versus ongoing income reached a low point. But since 1970, wealth has made a comeback, powered considerably by an increase in the value of houses\\xe2\\x80\\x94primarily urban and suburban land in the London area.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>3) The return of inequality in Germany</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204565/capital_in_germany.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Capital_in_germany\">The story of German wealth is different from the British story in almost every detail. \"Net foreign capital,\" meaning German ownership of foreign assets, was not very important in the pre-World War I era. <span class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\">Instead wealth</span> was driven overwhelmingly by \"other domestic capital,\" meaning the value of German industrial and commercial enterprises. German wealth was, of course, massively destroyed by the world wars. But it\\'s rebounded strongly since its low point. Interesting, despite Germany\\'s vaunted industrial capabilities the rebound has <i>not</i> been driven by a large increase in domestic capital. Instead the key sectors are domestic housing and ownership of foreign assets.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>4) America\\'s age of equality</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204589/Capital_in_the_United_States.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Capital_in_the_united_states\">American economic history looks very different from Britain or Germany. We apparently enjoyed an edenic early period prior to 1880 in which accumulated wealth was small relative to ongoing income. This was a world in which a few years of hard work could, it seems, easily help you stack up against the might of the already wealthy. Many of America\\'s enduring narratives about itself clearly owe a debt to this early period, even though the more recent trajectory has been different.</p> \\\\n<h3> \\\\n<div id=\"slaves\"><span>5) The fall of the slaveholding aristocracy</span></div> \\\\n</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204611/United_States_With_Slavery.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"United_states_with_slavery\"></p> \\\\n<p>The image of early 19th century America has a relatively egalitarian landscape turns out to neglect something important: slavery. Millions of people of African ancestry were held in bondage, making the idea of hard work as the ticket to success a joke. And possession of their labor was extremely valuable. As this chart illustrates, slave wealth was slightly more valuable than all the agricultural land in the country put together. It was also more valuable than all the factories and railroads and canals combined. In a world of relatively abundant land and high wages, owning black people was <i>the</i> key to wealth. And the process of emancipation was possibly the single greatest expropriation of wealth in human history.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>6) The varieties of capitalism</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204627/market_value_and_book_value.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Market_value_and_book_value\">This chart is a little difficult to understand, but it\\'s very deep. For several different countries, it compares the \"market value\" of their companies (i.e., what it would cost to buy all the shares of their stock) to the \"book value\" of the companies (i.e., the value of the factories, patents, offices, etc. that the companies own). This lets us see that in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom share prices are high relative to the book value of companies. The Anglophone countries have shareholder-friendly legal systems in which the owners of stock control enterprises. In Germany, stocks are much less valuable because the legal system gives much more weight to the interests of employees and other stakeholders. France is an intermediate case. These different conceptions of capitalism coexist with vast sums of wealth at stake in the difference between them.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>7) The really really rich are different from you and me</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4204659/income_composition.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Income_composition\">This chart shows that the vast majority of people in the top 10 percent of the American income distribution earn a living the way most of us do \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they work for it. But among the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent things are different. Labor income \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wages and salaries \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are a distinct minority of total earnings. The truly rich don\\'t get their money by working for high pay. They get their money as a consequence of their pre-existing wealth.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>8) Wealth is much more unequal than income</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207471/wealth_inequality.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Wealth_inequality\">You hear a lot about income inequality, but as this chart makes clear wealth inequality is <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i>much </i>more severe. In the United States, just 1 percent of the population owns about 35 percent of all the wealth. Even in relatively egalitarian Europe, the top 1 percent owns around 25 percent of the wealth. In both continents, the top 10 percent owns over half the wealth. Near the bottom of the spectrum, wealth is typically negative as people have more in debt (whether because of student loans, credit cards, or underwater mortgages) than they have in assets.</p> \\\\n<h3><span>9) The billionaires boom</span></h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/assets/4207487/billionaires.png\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"Billionaires\"></p> \\\\n<p>We are living through a golden age of billionaires. In 1996 there were about 400 billionaires. That number has more than tripled. But the total wealth under the control of billionaires has grown even faster \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over five-fold in less than two decades. The trend reflects both growing inequality in rich countries, and growing prosperity in China and other relatively poor ones. The point here is that not only is wealth held unequally, the inequality appears to be growing fractally with the very richest of the rich growing richer at the fastest pace.</p>\\n', b'Remember when legal marijuana was going to send crime skyrocketing?\\tGerman Lopez\\tCriminal Justice\\t2014-04-03 23:25:55\\t2014-05-06 21:58:42\\thttp://www.vox.com/2014/4/3/5563134/marijuana-legalization-crime-denver-colorado\\t\"Three months after legalizing marijuana, Denver defies the early warnings from legalization opponents.\"\\t<p><span>When Colorado legalized recreational marijuana sales, Denver embraced the opportunity with open arms.</span></p> \\\\n<p>The city is now home to more than 62 percent of all Colorado recreational marijuana retailers, who cashed in on <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/10/colorado-marijuana-tax-revenue_n_4936223.html\">$14 million in sales</a> in January alone.</p> \\\\n<p><span>Other cities weren\\'t so eager: heeding legalization opponents\\'  safety concerns, several pushed off licensing retail sales.

Compared to the first two months of 2013, property crime in  January and February actually dropped by 12.1 percent. Reports of  robberies and stolen property dropped by 6.2 percent and 13 percent,  respectively. Burglaries and criminal mischief to property rose by only  0.5 percent.</p> \\\\n<p>Denver residents don\\'t seem especially concerned with the issue,  either. Susman recalls a recent community meeting she held with senior  citizens: when she asked if the crowd wanted her to talk about  marijuana, people told her they were tired of hearing about the issue.</p> \\\\n<p>\"Based on my general understanding in my district, it is becoming ho-hum,\" Susman says.</p> \\\\n<h3>Three months is still a short time frame</h3> \\\\n<p><span> </span></p> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236449/459964349.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"459964349\"></p> \\\\n<p class=\"caption\">Recreational sales began in January. Theo Stroomer / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Some groups caution that it\\'s too early to tell whether legalization will cause public safety issues in the long term.</p> \\\\n<p>\"We quite frankly don\\'t know,\" Smart Colorado spokesperson Henny  Lasley says. Her group, formed after legalization, focuses on keeping marijuana away from children. \"We\\'ve had three complete months of retail marijuana. We  were getting those questions three days into legalization. It\\'s a pretty  short window.\"</p> \\\\n<p><span>Tom Gorman, director of </span><span>Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, thinks the</span><span> full effects  won\\'t surface until, at best, three to four years. </span></p> \\\\n<p>\"This is a great opportunity for us to find out what happens when you  legalize a substance like marijuana,\" Gorman says. \"Just wait and watch  what happens in these labs, and then you can make a decision based on  data and facts and not rhetoric.\"</p> \\\\n<p>Some marijuana legalization opponents, on the other hand, have  adopted a softer opinion. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, who opposed  legalization, <a href=\"http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/24/how-has-legalization-of-marijuana-changed-denver/\">told CNN</a> that the city\\'s dive into recreational marijuana went smoothly. And  despite some concerns about property crime, he said the city saw  \"nothing that has raised a major red flag.\"</p> \\\\n<h3>Medical marijuana hasn\\'t led to an increase in crime</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236429/98049962.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"98049962\"></p> \\\\n<p class=\"caption\">Medical marijuana in California. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>Outside of Colorado, most research on crime and marijuana looks at legalization for medicinal purposes. <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092816\">One study</a> published in PLOS ONE concluded the expansion of medical marijuana did not lead to more violent or property crime, and <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/explains/marijuana-legalization/what-is-medical-marijuana\">medical marijuana</a> legalization might in fact correlate with a reduction in some crimes.</p> \\\\n<p>Researcher Robert Morris suggests that taking marijuana purchases out of an illicit market could reduce crime overall. \"Perhaps there\\'s additional crime associated with the criminal  marketplace to begin with,\" he says.</p> \\\\n<p>Alternatively, crime could decrease if people began substituting alcohol with marijuana. \"We know there\\'s a  pretty strong link between alcohol misuse and crime, particularly in a  person of violence,\" Morris says. \"There\\'s not as much of a correlation  between marijuana use and crimes.\"</p> \\\\n<p>Still, Morris cautions that the potential for crime reduction needs  more study. He also says the findings don\\'t necessarily apply to full  marijuana legalization, and he would like to study that issue in further  detail.</p> \\\\n<h3>But concerns remain about businesses\\' cash holdings</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236413/143182883.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"143182883\"></p> \\\\n<p class=\"caption\">People celebrating 4/20 in Denver. Marc Piscotty / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p>If there\\'s a reason for crime to increase following marijuana  legalization, it may be the fine line marijuana businesses walk between  legalization at the state level and criminality at the federal level.</p> \\\\n<p>Many banks decline to open accounts for marijuana sellers since the  federal government still considers the drug illegal. As a result, many  marijuana businesses hold raw cash \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sometimes tens of thousands of  dollars \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from profits and to pay their bills. (The Obama  administration, for its part, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/cards/marijuana-legalization/federal-government-deal-legal-marijuana\">issued guidances</a> telling prosecutors and regulators to prioritize issues other than marijuana in states where the drug is legal. But banks <a href=\"http://www.aba.com/Press/Pages/021414FinCenGuidance.aspx\">remain skeptical</a> without changes in the law itself.)</p> \\\\n<p>Keeping cash on hand can be dangerous; a large stash of bills can be an easy target for crime. <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w19996\">One study</a> from researchers at the University of Missouri at St. Louis and Georgia State University found raw cash in welfare programs can lead to higher crime rates due to its liquidity and anonymity in  transactions. Researchers found that Missouri counties that moved to electronic welfare benefits, from cash, saw crime drop by nearly 10 percent following the transition.</p> \\\\n<p>Denver District Attorney Morrissey says the  amount of cash at marijuana businesses will near certainly lead to more crime.  \"You hit a 7-Eleven in Denver, you might get $20 to $100,\" he said in an interview. \"You hit a dispensary on a good day, who knows? You might get $30,000 in cash.\"</p> \\\\n<p>City Council President Susman also worries the large amount of cash  flowing in and out of these businesses could become an easy target for  criminals.</p> \\\\n<p>\"A grow operation will have a $20,000 or $30,000 utility bill a  month,\" she says. \"They have to show up at the utility\\'s office with  $20,000 or $30,000 in a briefcase.\"</p> \\\\n<h3>Other Colorado cities are following Denver\\'s lead</h3> \\\\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4236503/98555840.jpg\" class=\"photo\" alt=\"98555840\"></p> \\\\n<p class=\"caption\">Some cities aren\\'t resisting this offer. Chris Hondros / Getty Images News</p> \\\\n<p><span>After Denver\\'s smooth transition, other major cities in Colorado now  appear ready to join.
